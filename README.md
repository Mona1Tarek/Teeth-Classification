### Teeth Classification - Preprocessing, Visualization, and Model Training

This project focuses on building a comprehensive computer vision model for classifying teeth into 7 distinct categories based on dental images. Accurate classification of teeth is crucial for developing AI-driven dental solutions, which can enhance diagnostic precision and improve patient outcomes in the healthcare industry. This project is designed to contribute to our company's strategic goals in healthcare by supporting more precise dental diagnostics through advanced machine learning techniques.

The project is divided into three main components:

1. **Preprocessing**: Preparing the dental images for analysis through normalization and augmentation. Preprocessing ensures that the data is optimized for model training, improving the overall performance and generalization of the model.

2. **Visualization**: Analyzing and visualizing the dataset to understand the distribution of different classes. Visualizations also help in assessing the impact of data augmentation techniques by comparing images before and after transformations.

3. **Model Architecture and Training**: Using popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, we develop a custom model tailored for teeth classification. The goal is to establish a strong performance baseline, which can be further improved with more advanced techniques or optimizations.

This teeth classification solution is a critical component of our company's AI strategy in healthcare, aimed at automating and enhancing dental diagnostics, ultimately leading to better patient care and treatment outcomes.
